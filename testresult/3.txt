Summary:

Little Red-Cap is a story about a young girl who is loved by everyone around her, especially her grandmother. One day, she is given the task of taking cake and wine to her sick grandmother who lives deep in the woods. On her way there, she meets a wolf who tries to trick her into leaving the path. Despite his attempts, Little Red-Cap remains cautious and does not stray from the path.

Upon reaching her grandmother's house, she finds it unlocked and enters only to find her grandmother has been eaten by the same wolf who had tried to deceive her earlier. The wolf then tries to eat Little Red-Cap as well but is discovered by a passing huntsman who saves both Little Red-Cap and her grandmother.

Later, when Little Red-Cap brings more cake and wine to her grandmother, they encounter another wolf who tries to trick them again. This time, the grandmother and Little Red-Cap outsmart the wolf by boiling sausages in a trough which causes the wolf to slip and drown. The story ends with Little Red-Cap returning home safely and never being harmed again.
