Summary:

Once upon a time, a poor wood-cutter lived with his wife and their two children, Hansel and Gretel. Due to a great famine, the family could not afford daily bread, and the father considered leaving his children alone in the forest to die of hunger. However, his wife convinced him to do so, and they took the children into the woods, leaving them with only one piece of bread each.

Hansel, knowing that he would need food for their journey back home, secretly collected pebbles from their yard which resembled white bread crumbs. When the family reached the forest, Hansel scattered these pebbles on the ground to guide them back home. The father built a fire and gave each child a piece of bread, telling them to save it for later.

When night fell, the children fell asleep, and their parents left them in the woods. However, Hansel had planned ahead and used his pebbles to find their way back home. They returned just as their parents were about to leave again, and the father was filled with remorse for almost abandoning his children.

Years later, another great famine struck the land, and the wood-cutter's wife convinced him to take Hansel and Gretel deeper into the forest, intending to leave them there to die. Once again, Hansel secretly collected pebbles from their yard, which he scattered on the path as they ventured further into the woods.

The family reached a beautiful house made of bread and covered with sugar, built by a wicked witch who lured children into her home to eat them. The witch pretended to be kind and invited Hansel and Gretel inside, offering them food and a place to sleep. However, she had other plans for the siblings.

The witch locked Hansel in a stable and ordered Gretel to cook him for her to eat. Gretel, however, managed to trick the witch by locking her in an oven instead. The two children escaped from the witch's forest and made their way back home, bringing with them chests full of pearls and jewels they found in the witch's house.

Their father was overjoyed to have his children back, and they all lived happily ever after.
