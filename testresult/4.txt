Summary:

Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Little Red-Cap who was loved by everyone around her, especially her grandmother. One day, her mother gives her a piece of cake and a bottle of wine to take to her sick grandmother. She is warned not to run off the path or she might break the bottle.

On her way to her grandmother's house in the wood, Little Red-Cap meets a wolf who tries to trick her into leaving the path. Despite his attempts, she remains cautious and continues on her way. The wolf then goes to Little Red-Cap's grandmother's house and pretends to be the girl, eating the old woman and dressing up in her clothes.

Little Red-Cap arrives at her grandmother's house and finds it open. She enters and is surprised by how strange her grandmother looks. The wolf, still in the bed, tries to scare Little Red-Cap away but she manages to escape. A huntsman passing by hears her screams and comes to help. He cuts open the wolf's stomach and finds both Little Red-Cap and her grandmother inside. They are saved, and the huntsman kills the wolf.

Little Red-Cap learns a lesson about not leaving the path and continues to take care of her grandmother. Later, she encounters another wolf who tries to trick her again but she is on her guard and does not fall for his tricks. The grandmother and Little Red-Cap devise a plan to trap the wolf by boiling some sausages and using the water to fill a trough. The wolf smells the sausages, slips, and falls into the trough where he drowns.

Little Red-Cap returns home safely and no one ever harms her again.
