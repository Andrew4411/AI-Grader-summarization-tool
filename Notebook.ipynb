      "The wolf thought to himself, what a tender young creature.  What a\n",
      "nice plump mouthful, she will be better to eat than the old\n",
      "woman.  I must act craftily, so as to catch both.  So he walked\n",
      "for a short time by the side of little red-cap, and then he\n",
      "said, \"see little red-cap, how pretty the flowers are about here.\n",
      "Why do you not look round.  I believe, too, that you do not\n",
      "hear how sweetly the little birds are singing.  You walk gravely\n",

      "fresh nosegay.  That would please her too.  It is so early in the\n",
      "day that I shall still get there in good time.  And so she ran\n",
      "from the path into the wood to look for flowers.  And whenever\n",
      "she had picked one, she fancied that she saw a still prettier one\n",
      "farther on, and ran after it, and so got deeper and deeper into\n",
      "the wood.\n",

      "The wolf lifted the latch, the door sprang open, and without\n",
      "saying a word he went straight to the grandmother's bed, and\n",

      "her cap, laid himself in bed and drew the curtains.\n",
      "\n",
      "Little red-cap, however, had been running about picking flowers,\n",
      "and when she had gathered so many that she could carry\n",

      "way to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was surprised to find the cottage-door standing open, and\n",
      "when she went into the room, she had such a strange feeling that\n",
      "she said to herself, oh dear, how uneasy I feel to-day, and at\n",
      "other times I like being with grandmother so much.  She called\n",
      "out, \"good morning,\" but received no answer.  So she went to the\n",
      "bed and drew back the curtains.  There lay her grandmother with\n",
      "her cap pulled far over her face, and looking very strange.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, grandmother,\" she said, \"what big ears you have.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The better to hear you with, my child,\" was the reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But, grandmother, what big eyes you have,\" she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The better to see you with,\" my dear.\n",

      "\"The better to hug you with.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, but, grandmother, what a terrible big mouth you have.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The better to eat you with.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And scarcely had the wolf said this, than with one bound he was\n",
      "out of bed and swallowed up red-cap.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the wolf had appeased his appetite, he lay down again in\n",
      "the bed, fell asleep and began to snore very loud.  The\n",
      "huntsman was just passing the house, and thought to himself, how\n",
      "the old woman is snoring.  I must just see if she wants anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "So he went into the room, and when he came to the bed, he saw\n",
      "that the wolf was lying in it.  Do I find you here, you old\n",
      "sinner, said he.  I have long sought you.  Then just as he was going\n",
      "to fire at him, it occurred to him that the wolf might have\n",
      "devoured the grandmother, and that she might still be saved, so\n",
      "he did not fire, but took a pair of scissors, and began to cut\n",
      "open the stomach of the sleeping wolf.  When he had made two\n",
      "snips, he saw the little red-cap shining, and then he made two\n",
      "snips more, and the little girl sprang out, crying, ah, how\n",
      "frightened I have been.  How dark it was inside the wolf.  And\n",
      "after that the aged grandmother came out alive also, but scarcely\n",
      "able to breathe.  Red-cap, however, quickly\n",
      "fetched great stones with which they filled the wolf's belly, and\n",
      "when he awoke, he wanted to run away, but the stones were so\n",
      "heavy that he collapsed at once, and fell dead.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then all three were delighted.  The huntsman drew off the wolf's\n",
      "skin and went home with it.  The grandmother ate the cake and\n",
      "drank the wine which red-cap had brought, and revived, but\n",
      "red-cap thought to herself, as long as I live, I will never by\n",
      "myself leave the path, to run into the wood, when my mother has\n",
      "forbidden me to do so.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is also related that once when red-cap was again taking cakes\n",
      "to the old grandmother, another wolf spoke to her, and tried to\n",
      "entice her from the path.  Red-cap, however, was on her guard,\n",
      "and went straight forward on her way, and told her grandmother\n",
      "that she had met the wolf, and that he had said good-morning to\n",
      "her, but with such a wicked look in his eyes, that if they had\n",
      "not been on the public road she was certain he would have eaten\n",
      "her up.  Well, said the grandmother, we will shut the door, that\n",
      "he may not come in.  Soon afterwards the wolf knocked, and cried,\n",
      "open the door, grandmother, I am little red-cap, and am bringing\n",
      "you some cakes.  But they did not speak, or open the door, so\n",
      "the grey-beard stole twice or thrice round the house, and at last\n",
      "jumped on the roof, intending to wait until red-cap went home in\n",
      "the evening, and then to steal after her and devour her in the\n",
      "darkness.  But the grandmother saw what was in his thoughts.  In\n",
      "front of the house was a great stone trough, so she said to the\n",
      "child, take the pail, red-cap.  I made some sausages yesterday,\n",
      "so carry the water in which I boiled them to the trough.  Red-cap\n",
      "carried until the great trough was quite full.   Then the smell\n",
      "of the sausages reached the wolf, and he sniffed and peeped\n",
      "down, and at last stretched out his neck so far that he could\n",
      "no longer keep his footing and began to slip, and slipped down\n",
      "from the roof straight into the great trough, and was drowned.\n",
      "But red-cap went joyously home, and no one ever did anything\n",
      "to harm her again.```\n",
